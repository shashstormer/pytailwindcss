# pyTailwindCSS

* This is a module written to support generating basic TailwindCss using python only.
* This module was written as a subset of the [xtracto](https://github.com/shashstormer/xtracto) library then made into a seperate module to simplify contribution and development.
* You may fork and make a PR to [this repo]() to contribute to the development of this module.
